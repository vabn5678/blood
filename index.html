            <p class="shortage">The shortage of blood has been a major public health problem in India. Presently, there
                is a
                huge gap between the demand and supply of blood. As per 2021 statistics, the demand and supply ratio was
                1.46 vs 1.25 crore units. In every two seconds, someone in India needs blood. It is estimated that over
                12,000 persons die every day in India due to non-availability of blood. One of the major factors for the
                shortfall is lack of awareness and prevalence of myths about blood donation. According to WHO, for every
                1,000 people in any country, at least 10-20 donors are required to provide adequate supplies. Regular
                blood
                donation is needed to ensure that blood is always available whenever required.</p>

            <p class="shortage">
                Unfortunately, in our country, many people who need transfusions do not have timely access to
                safe blood. The prevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) including Hepatitis B
                virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV continues to remain high in India. WHO recommends
                that all blood donations should be screened for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis
                infections prior to use. In India, serological screening is mandatory for all donated blood for
                hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
                However, due to the window time for certain infections where the screening result can be falsely
                negative and the constant development of new variants, those who receive blood are still at risk
                of developing TTIs.
